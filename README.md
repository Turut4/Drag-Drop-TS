# Drag and Drop Learning Project

## Description
This project is a simple drag-and-drop interface built using TypeScript. It was created as part of my journey to learn and practice TypeScript and JavaScript event handling. The project includes basic drag-and-drop functionality where a draggable item can be moved and dropped into a designated drop zone.

## Features
- **Drag and Drop:** Basic implementation of drag-and-drop functionality.
- **TypeScript:** Written entirely in TypeScript to enforce type safety and better code practices.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized code for easier understanding and scalability.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
